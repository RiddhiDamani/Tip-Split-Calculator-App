# Tip-Split-Calculator-App

The Tip/Split Calculator Android app will assist you in calculating your total dining cost with a selected tip added and will 
allow you to split that total evenly for each person dining, specifying the amount owed by each person. 2 Layouts aof the Android 
app are taken into consideration: Portrait and Landscape. The app looks and act consistently in either portrait or landscape 
orientation. No data content is lost upon rotation (i.e., the Tip Amount, the Total with Tip, the Total per Person, and the
Overage values should be maintained upon rotation).

Inputs:
User inputs are: 
    (1) the original bill total, 
    (2) the desired tip percentage, and 
    (3) the number of people to split the total with tip.

After entering the bill total, selecting a tip percentage radio button should result in the tip
amount and total with tip included to be calculated, and their data fields on the UI to be filled
in (these values should all be displayed out to 2 decimal places).

After entering the Number of people value and tapping the “GO” button, the total per person
and “overage” values should be calculated and their data fields on the UI should be filled in
(these values should be displayed out to 2 decimal places).

Pressing the “Clear” button will clear all fields
